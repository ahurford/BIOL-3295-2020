Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p1-3. Link 3.2 Questions Submit your answers to Brightspace Let \\(\\lambda = 5\\) in equation (3) (see the required reading). Explain the meaning of \\(\\lambda = 5\\). Suppose the number of lilypads during week 7 is 150. Let \\(\\lambda = 5\\), and assume that the units of \\(t\\) are weeks. Use equation (3) to calculate the number of lilypads in week 8. Use your answer to question 2. to calculate the number of lilypads in week 9. Equation (4) for the required reading assumes that \\(N_0=1\\), however, this formula can be generalized such that \\[ N_t = N_0\\lambda^t \\] where \\(N_t\\) is the population size at time, \\(t\\). Define time such that \\(t=0\\) is week 7 and \\(t\\) is then the number of weeks since week 7. Use the the equation above to answer question 3 and confirm that the answer is the same (i.e., find the population size for week 9, when \\(\\lambda=5\\) and the population size for week 7 is 150). Use the formula from question 4 to find the population size for week 15, where \\(N_0\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) are the same as question 4. It is important to note that all mathematical formulas should have the same units on both sides of the equals sign and for each term that is added or subtracted. The units of the population size, \\(N_t\\), at time, \\(t\\), are number. The geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\) is unitless. Choose a formula from the required reading and give the units for each of the terms to show that both sides of the equals have the same units. For example, for the equation that appears in question 4, we have: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} N_t &amp; = &amp; N_0 \\lambda^t \\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp;(\\mbox{number}) (\\mbox{unitless})^{weeks}\\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp; \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} (\\mbox{unitless}) \\times (\\mbox{quantity with units}) &amp; = &amp; (\\mbox{quantity with units}) \\\\ (\\mbox{unitless})^{(\\mbox{quantity})}&amp; =&amp; (\\mbox{unitless}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Although not stated in the reading, \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\) where \\(b\\) is the per capita birth rate over one time step (i.e. one week for this example), and \\(d\\) is the fraction of the lilypad population that dies over one time step. The number 1 is considered unitless, what must the units of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) be? In the reading, \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Given that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\), what are some possible values of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\). [True or False] For discrete time exponential growth (as per the reading), the change in population size from one week to the next depends not so much on the per capita birth rate, but on the difference between the per capita birth rate and the per capita death rate.

["friday-sept-18-protection-island-1.html", "5 Friday Sept 18: Protection Island 1 5.1 Questions", " 5 Friday Sept 18: Protection Island 1 The information below is taken from the following source: Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35 pheasants. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. 5.1 Questions Read and complete all the exercises in Chapters 6.3 Variables and assignment to 6.10 R packages and 11 Making graphs in R of Quantitative skills for biology HAND IN Answer all questions marked HAND IN in the reading To make a graph of the data listed in b.-d., we need to learn how to work with dates. We will consider two possible approaches: Use a built-in R function to convert dates to a format that can be plotted (this question); and Convert the dates to number of days since a reference date. Now the dates are numbers and these values can be plotted on the x-axis of a graph (question 3). In this question, we will proceed with option i. The function we will use is as.Date(). You can learn how to use this function using an internet search or by typing the following into your Console: ?as.Date These files can be difficult to understand (see R Help files. A good way to proceed is to experiment with the function in the Console. Try these: as.Date(2012-01-31, format = %Y-%m-%d) as.Date(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) Note that only the second command is error-free. The first command fails because the date argument for the as.Date() function must be a character string, i.e., must be enclosed in &quot;&quot; (see ?character). It is also possible to omit the format argument and just code: as.Date(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;). The help file notes that when the format argument is not specified, that formats will be tried one by one and an error will be returned if none work. It is advisable to specify the format, as allowing the function to infer the format could introduce errors. Chapter 6.9 Data structures describes how to make a vector (note a vector is a list of numbers rather than just a single number). We need to make a vector of the dates so that we can make our plot. For example, x &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;, &quot;2012-03-05&quot;, &quot;2013-01-11&quot;), format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) Having completed Chapter 11 Making graphs in R, and having learned how to work with dates, you should now be able to write an R script to make plot using the information in b.-d. above. HAND IN A graph and figure caption, which has dates on the x-axis and the pheasant population size on the y-axis drawing from the information provided in b.-d. You will need to guess the date of ‘before the breeding season’ as stated in b. and you should disclose the value of this guess in the figure caption. See 1.3.1 for more information. An R Script that produces the figure described above. See 1.3.2 for more information. Next, we try approach ii. to make the graph. Under approach ii. we will work with the dates by converting them to the number of days since a reference date. To do this we will use the julian() function, which is part of the chron package. Read Section 4.4 of Quantitative skills for biology regarding installing packages. Install the package chron using either the Install button on the Packages tab, or by using the command install.packages(&quot;chron&quot;) in the Console window. Note that the package is only available for use once you check the box on the Packages tab or by running the following command in the Console: require(&quot;chron&quot;) After the chron package is loaded, we can then query the julian function, ?julian or use an internet search to better understand how to use it. As the help files can be difficult to understand, another approach to is to try out the function. Try the following: julian(1,1,1970) julian(1,2,1970) julian(2,1,1970) julian(1,1,1971) julian(1,1,1969) Which argument position of julian() function corresponds to the month? Note also that by default the origin (the origin is the value of 0) is set to January 1, 1970. Experiment by running the following lines of code: julian(1,1,2000) julian(1,1,2000, origin = c(1,1,1970)) julian(1,1,2000, origin = c(1,1,2000)) Finally, we need to make our figure. Recall that the plot function requires vectors of equal length for the x- and y-axes. Make a vector of the days since a reference as follows: ref.day = c(1,1,2000) x = c(julian(1,1,2000, origin = ref.day), julian(1,1,2002, origin = ref.day)) If you run into problems you can query the value of x in your console, and you can use length(x) to check the length of x. HAND IN As for question 2. you need to hand in a graph with descriptive axes and with a figure caption. The y-axis on your graph is population size and the x-axis will be created using the julian() function. Be sure to label the x-axis differently than you did in question 2. You also need to produce an R Script that makes the figure described above. See 1.3.2 for more information. Name this file protection-island-q3.R For the discrete time exponential (geometric) growth model, ideally the census points should be a fixed amount of time apart, i.e., a day, a week, or a year. HAND IN Provide 1-3 sentences discussing the timing of the census points for Protection Island. "],
["tues-sept-22-protection-island-2.html", "6 Tues Sept 22: Protection Island 2 6.1 Questions", " 6 Tues Sept 22: Protection Island 2 Here is some additional information also taken from: Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season: 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\\(^1\\) You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species. \\(^1\\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory. 6.1 Questions Let \\(d\\) be the fraction of population that dies each year. What is \\(d\\) for the ring-tailed pheasant population on Protection Island? Write down any assumptions you have made. \\(b\\) is the per capita number of births each year. What is the value of \\(b\\)? Write down any assumptions you have made. Recall that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b-d\\). What is the value of \\(\\lambda\\)? Is this population is exected to grow over time? Lets assume that the pheasant population on Protection Island grows geoemetrically (i.e. exponentially) where the geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\), is the value that you estimated in 5. Lets predict the population size each May beginning with May 1937. Let \\(N_0 = 10\\) and let \\(t\\) be the number of years since May 1937. Recall that when a population grows geometrically, \\[N_{t} = N_0 \\lambda^t \\] You can use R to do this calculation as follows (you should use your value of \\(\\lambda\\) from question 5): t &lt;-1 N0 &lt;-10 lambda &lt;-3 N0*lambda^t where since \\(t = 1\\) the result of N0*lambda^t is \\(N_{t+1}\\), with \\(t=1\\), such that N0*lambda^t is the value of \\(N_{t+1}=N_2\\): the population size two years after May 1937. You can change the value of \\(t\\) and repeat the calculation. Unless you have cleared your workshop it won’t be necessary to re-input \\(N_0 = 10\\) and \\(\\lambda = 3\\). As such, you can calculate \\(N_3\\) with the following commands: t &lt;-2 N0*lambda^t HAND IN Use R to predict the value of the pheasant population size every year up until May 1940. The approach to calculating the pheasant population size in Question 6 is not very organized. In this question, we will learn how to make a data frame, use a for loop, and use the function rbind(). Read Data structures in Quantitative training for biology. Create a one row dataframe called df: df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) Query df in your Console to see the data frame you have created. We would like to add successive values of the population size that we calculate to the data frame. To do this we use the rbind() function, which binds rows together. new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) Here the rbind() function takes the df dataframe and adds the new.result data frame as a new row onto the bottom. Note that the code above overwrites the value of df: that is, new.result is added to the bottom of the df dataframe (containing only one row), and the result is called df (which now has two rows), and the old dataframe df (with one row) is overwritten. As such, each time you run the command df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) another row is added to df. Try the following: new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) If you query the value of df you can see that the several rows, all with identical values have been added because we have run the command df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) multiple times while the value of new.result is unchanged. Now let’s change the value of new.result between each time we run the df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) command. new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 2, popn.size = 30) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) Finally, when we do calculations for a sequence of values, it is easier to code this using a for loop. lambda &lt;- 1.2 N0 &lt;- 10 df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) for(t in seq(1,4,1)){ val &lt;- N0*lambda^t new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = t, popn.size = val) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) } To understand the above code, after copy and pasting it into your Console, query the value of df: you should see predicted population sizes up until 4 years after May 1937. Now, lets try to understand seq(1,4,1). Let’s learn about the seq() function by trying it out in the Console. What is the result of each of these? seq(-10,10) seq(-10,5,0.1) The for loop works by beginning with t equal to the first value of the sequence and stepping through each value until the final value. The code is written so that quantities that depend on t are inside the for loop (i.e., enclosed with in the {} and those that do not depend on t are outside the for loop). Note that val changes for different values of t, new.result changes for different values of t (because new.result has time = t and pop.size = val, where val depends on t). Finally, df also depends on t, because new.result depends on t. In contrast, N0 and lambda do not change with t, so it is more efficient to place the allocated values for these parameters outside of the loop. We can also plot the results of our calculations: lambda &lt;- 2 N0 &lt;- 10 df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) for(t in seq(1,4,1)){ val &lt;- N0*lambda^t new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = t, popn.size = val) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) } plot(df$time, df$popn.size, typ = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;years since May 1937&quot;, ylab = &quot;Population size&quot;) If you already have an existing plot you can add new lines using lines(). For example, plot(seq(1,4), c(1,3,4,2), ylab = &quot;y-axis&quot;, xlab = &quot;x-axis&quot;) lines(seq(1,4), seq(1,4)) HAND IN Write an R scipt that builds on the file you have previously make protection-island-q3.R. Use the lines() command to add the predicted population size assuming geometric growth using the commands described in this section. If you have written the code correctly the result should look something like this: ref.day = c(1,1,2000) #x = c(julian(1,1,2000, origin = ref.day), julian(1,1,2002, origin = ref.day)) The geometric growth model is called ‘discrete time’. This equation is appropriate for populations that have regular, pulse reproduction, for example, pheasants that reproduce once per year in the summer. Can you think of examples of other species that reproduce like this? Can you think of any species that reproduce continuously throughout the year? These species are better modelled with a continuous time model. "],
