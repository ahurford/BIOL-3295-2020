Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p1-3. Link 3.2 Questions Submit your answers to Brightspace Let \\(\\lambda = 5\\) in equation (3) (see the required reading). Explain the meaning of \\(\\lambda = 5\\). Suppose the number of lilypads during week 7 is 150. Let \\(\\lambda = 5\\), and assume that the units of \\(t\\) are weeks. Use equation (3) to calculate the number of lilypads in week 8. Use your answer to question 2. to calculate the number of lilypads in week 9. Equation (4) for the required reading assumes that \\(N_0=1\\), however, this formula can be generalized such that \\[ N_t = N_0\\lambda^t \\] where \\(N_t\\) is the population size at time, \\(t\\). Define time such that \\(t=0\\) is week 7 and \\(t\\) is then the number of weeks since week 7. Use the the equation above to answer question 3 and confirm that the answer is the same (i.e., find the population size for week 9, when \\(\\lambda=5\\) and the population size for week 7 is 150). Use the formula from question 4 to find the population size for week 15, where \\(N_0\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) are the same as question 4. It is important to note that all mathematical formulas should have the same units on both sides of the equals sign and for each term that is added or subtracted. The units of the population size, \\(N_t\\), at time, \\(t\\), are number. The geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\) is unitless. Choose a formula from the required reading and give the units for each of the terms to show that both sides of the equals have the same units. For example, for the equation that appears in question 4, we have: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} N_t &amp; = &amp; N_0 \\lambda^t \\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp;(\\mbox{number}) (\\mbox{unitless})^{weeks}\\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp; \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} (\\mbox{unitless}) \\times (\\mbox{quantity with units}) &amp; = &amp; (\\mbox{quantity with units}) \\\\ (\\mbox{unitless})^{(\\mbox{quantity})}&amp; =&amp; (\\mbox{unitless}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Although not stated in the reading, \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\) where \\(b\\) is the per capita birth rate over one time step (i.e. one week for this example), and \\(d\\) is the fraction of the lilypad population that dies over one time step. The number 1 is considered unitless, what must the units of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) be? In the reading, \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Given that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\), what are some possible values of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\). [True or False] For discrete time exponential growth (as per the reading), the change in population size from one week to the next depends not so much on the per capita birth rate, but on the difference between the per capita birth rate and the per capita death rate.

Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35 pheasants. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. 5.1 Questions Read and complete all the exercises in Chapters 6.3 Variables and assignment to 6.10 R packages and 11 Making graphs in R of Quantitative skills for biology HAND IN Answer all questions marked HAND IN in the reading To make a graph of the data listed in b.-d., we need to learn how to work with dates. We will consider two possible approaches: Use a built-in R function to convert dates to a format that can be plotted (this question); and Convert the dates to number of days since a reference date. Now the dates are numbers and these values can be plotted on the x-axis of a graph (question 3). In this question, we will proceed with option i. The function we will use is as.Date(). You can learn how to use this function using an internet search or by typing the following into your Console: ?as.Date These files can be difficult to understand (see R Help files. A good way to proceed is to experiment with the function in the Console. Try these: as.Date(2012-01-31, format = %Y-%m-%d) as.Date(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) Note that only the second command is error-free. The first command fails because the date argument for the as.Date() function must be a character string, i.e., must be enclosed in &quot;&quot; (see ?character). It is also possible to omit the format argument and just code: as.Date(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;). The help file notes that when the format argument is not specified, that formats will be tried one by one and an error will be returned if none work. It is advisable to specify the format, as allowing the function to infer the format could introduce errors. Chapter 6.9 Data structures describes how to make a vector (note a vector is a list of numbers rather than just a single number). We need to make a vector of the dates so that we can make our plot. For example, x &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;, &quot;2012-03-05&quot;, &quot;2013-01-11&quot;), format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) Having completed Chapter 11 Making graphs in R, and having learned how to work with dates, you should now be able to write an R script to make plot using the information in b.-d. above. HAND IN A graph and figure caption, which has dates on the x-axis and the pheasant population size on the y-axis drawing from the information provided in b.-d. You will need to guess the date of ‘before the breeding season’ as stated in b. and you should disclose the value of this guess in the figure caption. See 1.3.1 for more information. An R Script that produces the figure described above. See 1.3.2 for more information. Next, we try approach ii. to make the graph. Under approach ii. we will work with the dates by converting them to the number of days since a reference date. To do this we will use the julian() function, which is part of the chron package. Read Section 4.4 of Quantitative skills for biology regarding installing packages. Install the package chron using either the Install button on the Packages tab, or by using the command install.packages(&quot;chron&quot;) in the Console window. Note that the package is only available for use once you check the box on the Packages tab or by running the following command in the Console: require(&quot;chron&quot;) After the chron package is loaded we can then query the julian function, ?julian or use an internet search. As the help files can be difficult to understand, another approach to is to try out the function. Try the following: julian(1,1,1970) julian(1,2,1970) julian(2,1,1970) julian(1,1,1971) julian(1,1,1969) Which argument position of julian() function corresponds to the month? Note also that by default the origin (such that the returned value is 0) is set to January 1, 1970. Experiment by running the following lines of code: julian(1,1,2000) julian(1,1,2000, origin = c(1,1,1970)) julian(1,1,2000, origin = c(1,1,2000)) Finally, we need to make our figure. Recall that the plot function requires vectors of equal length for the x- and y-axes. Make a vector of the days since a reference as follows: ref.day = c(1,1,2000) x = c(julian(1,1,2000, origin = ref.day), julian(1,1,2002, origin = ref.day)) If you run into problems you can query the value of x in your console, and you can use length(x) to check the length of x. As for question 2. you need to hand in a graph with descriptive axes and with a figure caption. For the discrete time exponential (geometric) growth model, ideally the census points should be a fixed amount of time apart, i.e., a day, a week, or a year. Provide 1-3 sentences discussing the timing of the census points for Protection Island. "],

October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season: 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched.

Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species. \\(^1\\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory. 6.1 Questions Ideally, the census points should be exactly 1 year apart. When does the census occur on Protection Island? How does this relate to the biology of the pheasant? Graph the population size (y-axis) versus time (x-axis). You may draw the graph by hand or use a software of your choice. d is the fraction of population that dies each year. What is d for the ring-tailed pheasant population on Protection Island? Write down any assumptions you have made. b is the per capita number of births each year. What is the value of b? Write down any assumptions you have made. What is the value of λ? Is the population growing? Choose a value of N0 and use your estimated λ to predict future population sizes assuming geometric growth. Add these predictions to your plot. Add a legend to distinguish between the observed and the predicted population sizes. How do the observed and the predicted values of the population size compare? Give a reason why these may not match up exactly. Find the value of t when the population size is equal to 1000? What year does this correspond to? Estimate the doubling time of the pheasant population. State your assumptions for this calculation. The geometric growth model is called ‘discrete time’. This equation is appropriate for populations that have regular, pulse reproduction, for example, pheasants that reproduce once per year in the summer. Can you think of examples of other species that reproduce like this? Can you think of any species that reproduce continuously throughout the year? These species are better modelled with a continuous time model. "],
