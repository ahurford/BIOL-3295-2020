I am always available during the lecture times. Please email to request a meeting for a different time. Please check my schedule and suggest a time I am free that works for you. 1.2 Course Information TR 12.00-12.50pm F 1-1.50pm WebEx links for lecture times are on the course Brightspace under Announcements. Course description: Population and Evolutionary Ecology is an introduction to the theory and principles of evolutionary ecology and population dynamics. Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210. Course format: The course has been re-designed for online delivery. Specifically, no exams that require invigilation are part of the grading scheme because these are challenging to deliver remotely. Pre-recorded lectures limit my ability to interact with students. Therefore, I have elected to dedicate all lecture time to interacting with students. For each class there is a list of questions you are required to answer and hand-in. Prior to some classes there may be a Required Reading, that if completed will allow you to answer the day’s assignment questions. Prior to the day of class you should complete the Required Reading. In addition, I can most effectively help you if you have read over the questions ahead of time. Course expectations: Any students that are disruptive, violating university policies, or acting in a potentially unsafe way will be warned and asked to leave. Learning goals: I consider your completed assignments to be a portfolio of your knowledge in population and evolutionary ecology. You will also get some exposure to coding in R. It takes time to become proficient in a programming language, but the time you will spend coding in this class will help you towards becoming more proficient. The course content emphasizes a deeper understanding of fewer concepts. You have the opportunity to further explore a topic of interest to you for the final project. Required Text and Resources: The course materials are online at https://ahurford.github.io/BIOL-3295-Fall-2020/. In addition you will need a computer to install R and RStudio. This will be covered on Thursday Sept 17 (see Chapter 4). Class announcements and WebEx links will be provided on the course BrightSpace and your assignments are to be submitted to BrightSpace. 1.3 Method of Evaluation 27 assignments (equal weighting) - 50% Midterm (due Fri Nov 6 at 5pm) - 15% Final Project (due Monday Dec 14 at 9am) - 35% You should aim to complete each assignment before the next class, but assignments will be accepted, without penalty, up to a week later. Late assignments, labs, and missed midterms, and final exams will be accommodated as described by University Regulation 6.7.3 and 6.7.5 (see https://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0474 for Regulations). 1.4 Additional Policies 1.4.1 Accommodation of students with disabilities Memorial University of Newfoundland is committed to supporting inclusive education based on the principles of equity, accessibility and collaboration. Accommodations are provided within the scope of the University Policies for the Accommodations for Students with Disabilities see www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239. Students who may need an academic accommodation are asked to initiate the request with the Glenn Roy Blundon Centre at the earliest opportunity (see www.mun.ca/blundon for more information). 1.4.2 Academic misconduct Students are expected to adhere to those principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. A student has the responsibility to know which actions, as described under Academic Offences in the University Regulations, could be construed as dishonest or improper. Students found guilty of an academic offence may be subject to a number of penalties commensurate with the offence including reprimand, reduction of grade, probation, suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information regarding this policy, students should refer to University Regulation 6.12. 1.4.3 Equity and Diversity A safe learning environment will be provided for all students regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, social origin, religious creed, religion, age, disability, disfigurement, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, source of income or political opinion. You should not photograph or record myself, teaching assistants, or other students in the class without first obtaining permission. Accommodation will be made for students with special needs. The sound should be turned off on phones and computers during class. 1.5 Additional Supports Resources for additional support can be found at: www.mun.ca/currentstudents/student/ https://munsu.ca/resource-centres/ 1.6 Tentative course schedule The course schedule is found in the toolbar of the class materials, see https://ahurford.github.io/BIOL-3295-Fall-2020/. The last day to drop the course without academic prejudice is Wednesday Nov. 4. 1.7 Handing in your work 1.7.1 Making figures to hand-in The graphs you hand in need to have descriptive axeses and a figure caption. You may put these elements together using a word processing software such as Microsoft Word. Elements of a good figure caption: Has a label, i.e., “Figure 1”, The first sentences provides a summary of what the figure shows, i.e., “The price of oranges has increased steadily since 1964”, Provide all necessary information to understand everything in the figure, i.e., if the figure has no legend, but multiple line types/symbols, be sure to indicate what is represented by the different symbols. If the axes labels are overly brief due to space constraints in the graph, provide a more thorough description in the figure caption. If any assumptions have been made in making the figure, disclose these, i.e., a point that was excluded from the analysis due to being considered an outlier. 1.7.2 Writing R scripts to hand-in To write your own R scripts follow the guidelines described in Chapter 7 Best Practices of Quantitative training in Biology. If you are asked to hand in your R script this means you need to submit an .R file on Brightspace. "],

Explain in 1-2 sentences the meaning of \\(\\lambda = 5\\). [1 mark] Suppose the number of lilypads during week 7 is 78,125. Let \\(\\lambda = 5\\), and assume that the units of \\(t\\) are weeks. Use equation (3) to calculate the number of lilypads in week 8. Show your calculations. [2 marks] Use your answer to question 2. to calculate the number of lilypads in week 9. Show your calculations. [2 marks] Equation (4) for the required reading assumes that \\(N_0=1\\), however, this formula can be generalized such that \\[ N_t = N_0\\lambda^t \\] where \\(N_t\\) is the population size at time, \\(t\\). Define time such that \\(t=0\\) is week 7 and \\(t\\) is then the number of weeks since week 7. Use the equation above to answer question 3 and confirm that the answer is the same (i.e., find the population size for week 9, when \\(\\lambda=5\\) and the population size for week 7 is 78,125). Show your calculations. [2 marks] Use the formula from question 4 to find the population size for week 15, where \\(N_0=1\\) and \\(\\lambda=5\\). Define time as the number of weeks since week 0. Show your calculations [2 marks] It is important to note that all mathematical formulas should have the same units on both sides of the equals sign, and for each term that is added or subtracted. The units of the population size, \\(N_t\\), at time, \\(t\\), are number. The geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\) is unitless. Choose an equation from the required reading and give the units for each of the terms to show that both sides of the equals have the same units. For example, for the equation that appears in question 4, we have: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} N_t &amp; = &amp; N_0 \\lambda^t \\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp;(\\mbox{number}) (\\mbox{unitless})^{weeks}\\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp; \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} (\\mbox{unitless}) \\times (\\mbox{quantity with units}) &amp; = &amp; (\\mbox{quantity with units}) \\\\ (\\mbox{unitless})^{(\\mbox{quantity})}&amp; =&amp; (\\mbox{unitless}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] [2 marks] Although not stated in the reading, \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\) where \\(b\\) is the per capita birth rate over one time step (i.e. one week for this example), and \\(d\\) is the fraction of the lilypad population that dies over one time step. The number 1 is considered unitless, what must the units of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) be? [1 mark] In the reading, \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Given that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\), what are some possible values of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\). Note that \\(d\\) is a fraction and must be \\(1 \\geq d \\geq 0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\). [1 mark] [True or False] For discrete time exponential growth (as per the reading), the change in population size from one week to the next depends not so much on the per capita birth rate, but on the difference between the per capita birth rate and the per capita death rate.

["fri-sept-18-protection-island-1.html", "5 Fri Sept 18: Protection Island 1 5.1 Questions", " 5 Fri Sept 18: Protection Island 1 Today’s exercise will be challenging. You should aim to complete this exercise before the next class. This exercise is due by Fri Sept 25. There will be a lot of carryover to the next exercise. The information below is taken from the following source: Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35 pheasants. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. 5.1 Questions Read and complete all the exercises in Chapters 6.3 Variables and assignment to 6.10 R packages and 11 Making graphs in R of Quantitative skills for biology Answer all questions marked HAND IN in the reading [5 marks] To make a graph of the data listed in b.-d., we need to learn how to work with dates. We will consider two possible approaches: Use a built-in R function to convert dates to a format that can be plotted (todays class); and Convert the dates to number of days since a reference date. Now the dates are numbers and these values can be plotted on the x-axis of a graph (next class). In this question, we will proceed with option i. The function we will use is as.Date(). You can learn how to use this function using an internet search or by typing the following into your Console: ?as.Date These files can be difficult to understand (see R Help files. A good way to proceed is to experiment with the function in the Console. Try these: as.Date(2012-01-31, format = %Y-%m-%d) as.Date(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) Note that only the second command is error-free. The first command fails because the date argument for the as.Date() function must be a character string, i.e., must be enclosed in &quot;&quot; (see ?character). It is also possible to omit the format argument and just code: as.Date(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;). The help file notes that when the format argument is not specified, that formats will be tried one by one and an error will be returned if none work. It is advisable to specify the format, as allowing the function to infer the format could introduce errors. Chapter 6.9 Data structures describes how to make a vector (note a vector is a list of numbers rather than just a single number). We need to make a vector of the dates so that we can make our plot. For example, x &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;, &quot;2012-03-05&quot;, &quot;2013-01-11&quot;), format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) Having completed Chapter 11 Making graphs in R, and having learned how to work with dates, you should now be able to write an R script to make plot using the information in b.-d. above. HAND IN A graph and figure caption. The graph should have dates on the x-axis and the pheasant population size on the y-axis drawing from the information provided in b.-d. You will need to guess the date of ‘before the breeding season’ as stated in b. and you should disclose the value of this guess in the figure caption. See 1.7.1 for more information. The solutions to this problem have figure caption that is 2 sentences long. [Note that the graph will likely have years, not months on the x-axis - changing this is a quite fiddle-y and not worth it at this stage of your R journey] [10 marks] An R Script that produces the figure described above.

["tues-sept-22-protection-island-2.html", "6 Tues Sept 22: Protection Island 2 6.1 Questions", " 6 Tues Sept 22: Protection Island 2 Continuing from last week, today we will try approach ii. to make the graph of the number of pheasants on Protection Island as it changes with time. Under approach ii. we will work with the dates by converting them to the number of days since a reference date. To do this we will use the julian() function, which is part of the chron package. Today’s questions are due by Tues Sept 29, however, ideally you will have them completed for the next class. Read Section 4.4 of Quantitative skills for biology regarding installing packages. Install the package chron using either the Install button on the Packages tab, or by using the command install.packages(&quot;chron&quot;) in the Console window. Note that the package is only available for use once you check the box on the Packages tab or by running the following command in the Console: require(&quot;chron&quot;) After the chron package is loaded, we can then query the julian function, ?julian or use an internet search to better understand how to use it. As the help files can be difficult to understand, another approach to is to try out the function. Try the following: julian(1,1,1970) julian(1,2,1970) julian(2,1,1970) julian(1,1,1971) julian(1,1,1969) Which argument position of the julian() function corresponds to the month? Note also that by default the origin (the origin is when the returned value is 0) is set to January 1, 1970. Experiment by running the following lines of code: julian(1,1,2000) julian(1,1,2000, origin = c(1,1,1970)) julian(1,1,2000, origin = c(1,1,2000)) Finally, we need to make our figure. Recall that the plot function requires vectors of equal length for the x- and y-axes. Make a vector of the days since a reference date as follows: ref.day = c(1,1,2000) x = c(julian(1,1,2000, origin = ref.day), julian(1,1,2002, origin = ref.day)) If you run into problems you can query the value of x in your console, and you can use length(x) to check the length of x. 6.1 Questions You need to hand in a graph with descriptive axes and with a figure caption. The y-axis on your graph is population size and the x-axis will be created using the julian() function. Be sure to label the x-axis differently than you did for the previous assignment. See 1.7.1 for more information. The figure caption in the solutions for this problem is 2 sentences long. [10 marks] You also need to produce an R Script that makes the figure described above.

["thurs-sept-24-protection-island-3.html", "7 Thurs Sept 24: Protection Island 3 7.1 Questions", " 7 Thurs Sept 24: Protection Island 3 Here is some additional information also taken from: Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season: 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\\(^1\\) You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species. \\(^1\\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory. 7.1 Questions Let \\(d\\) be the fraction of population that dies each year. What is \\(d\\) for the ring-tailed pheasant population on Protection Island? Write down any assumptions you have made. [3 marks] \\(b\\) is the per capita number of births each year. What is the value of \\(b\\)? Write down any assumptions you have made. [3 marks] Recall that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b-d\\). What is the value of \\(\\lambda\\)? Is this population is expected to grow over time? [2 marks] Lets assume that the pheasant population on Protection Island grows geoemetrically (i.e. exponentially) where the geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\), is the value that you estimated in 5. Lets predict the population size each May beginning with May 1937. Let \\(N_0 = 10\\) and let \\(t\\) be the number of years since May 1937. Recall that when a population grows geometrically, \\[N_{t} = N_0 \\lambda^t \\] You can use R to do this calculation as follows (you should use your value of \\(\\lambda\\) from question 5, rather than lambda &lt;- 3 as in the example below): t &lt;-1 N0 &lt;-10 lambda &lt;-3 N0*lambda^t The result of N0*lambda^t is \\(N_{t+1}\\), and with \\(t=1\\), then \\(N_{t+1}=N_2\\): the population size two years after May 1937. You can change the value of \\(t\\) and repeat the calculation. Unless you have cleared your workspace it won’t be necessary to re-input \\(N_0 = 10\\) and \\(\\lambda = 3\\). As such, you can calculate \\(N_3\\) with the following commands: t &lt;-2 N0*lambda^t HAND IN Use R to predict the value of the pheasant population size every year up until May 1940. You only need to hand in the values that you get, not an R Script. [2 marks] The approach to calculating the pheasant population size in Question 6 is not very organized. In this question, we will learn how to make a data frame, use a for loop, and use the function rbind(). Read Data structures in Quantitative training for biology. Create a one row dataframe called df: df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) Query df in your Console to see the data frame you have created. We would like to add successive values of the population size that we calculate to the data frame. To do this we use the rbind() function, which binds rows together. new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) Here the rbind() function takes the df dataframe and adds the new.result data frame as a new row onto the bottom. Note that the code above overwrites the value of df: that is, new.result is added to the bottom of the df dataframe (containing only one row), and the result is called df (which now has two rows), and the old dataframe df (with one row) is overwritten. As such, each time you run the command df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) another row is added to df. Try the following: new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) If you query the value of df you can see that the several rows, all with identical values have been added because we have run the command df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) multiple times while the value of new.result is unchanged. Now let’s change the value of new.result between each time we run the df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) command. new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 2, popn.size = 30) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) Type df into the Console to see the resulting dataframe. Finally, when we do calculations for a sequence of values, it is easier to code this using a for loop. lambda &lt;- 1.2 N0 &lt;- 10 df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) for(t in seq(1,4,1)){ val &lt;- N0*lambda^t new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = t, popn.size = val) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) } To understand the above code, after copy and pasting it into your Console, query the value of df: you should see predicted population sizes up until 4 years after May 1937. Now, lets try to understand seq(1,4,1). Let’s learn about the seq() function by trying it out in the Console. What is the result of each of these? seq(-10,10) seq(-10,5,0.1) The for loop works by beginning with t equal to the first value of the sequence and stepping through each value until the final value. The code is written so that quantities that depend on t are inside the for loop (i.e., enclosed with in the {} and those that do not depend on t are outside the for loop). Note that val changes for different values of t, new.result changes for different values of t (because new.result has time = t and pop.size = val, where val depends on t). Finally, df also depends on t, because new.result depends on t. In contrast, N0 and lambda do not change with t, so it is more efficient to place the allocated values for these parameters outside of the loop. We can also plot the results of our calculations: lambda &lt;- 2 N0 &lt;- 10 df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) for(t in seq(1,4,1)){ val &lt;- N0*lambda^t new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = t, popn.size = val) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) } plot(df$time, df$popn.size, typ = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;years since May 1937&quot;, ylab = &quot;Population size&quot;) If you already have an existing plot you can add new lines using lines(). For example, plot(seq(1,4), c(1,3,4,2), ylab = &quot;y-axis&quot;, xlab = &quot;x-axis&quot;) lines(seq(1,4), seq(1,4)) HAND IN Write an R scipt that builds on the file you have previously made protection-island.R. Use the lines() command to add the predicted population size assuming geometric growth using the commands described in this section. If you have written the code correctly the result should look something like this: You are to hand in your R Script. See 1.7.2 for more information. [10 marks] "],

Discuss your graphs in the context of a principle in population and evolutionary ecology. Use Dias et al. 1996 Sources and sinks in population biology as a guide for what a final project that is a Review should aspire to look like. If you choose to do a final project that is an Analysis you should use some of the exercises we have completed for class as a guide (for example, the Doubling time, Protection Island, Yellow columbine, or balsam fir analyses). Note that you will need to write your final project as a report, rather than a series of questions. Some examples of final project topics are: Review paper: - Population dynamics in warming environments. - Population dynamics in seasonal environments. - Spatial population dynamics. - Metapopulations. Analysis: 30.1 How to read scientific papers Please consult How to Read a Scientific Paper (2014) for the recommended approach to ‘reading’ journal articles. Steps 1,2, and 4 are good advice, but step 3 may not be relevant for some readings. 30.2 Sources for datasets 30.3 Grading Rubric: Review 30.4 Grading Rubric: Analysis "],
