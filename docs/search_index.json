I am always available during the lecture times. Please email to request a meeting for a different time. Please check my schedule and suggest a time I am free that works for you. 1.2 Course Information TR 12.00-12.50pm F 1-1.50pm WebEx links for lecture times are on the course Brightspace under Announcements. Course description: Population and Evolutionary Ecology is an introduction to the theory and principles of evolutionary ecology and population dynamics. Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210. Course format: The course has been re-designed for online delivery. Specifically, no exams that require invigilation are part of the grading scheme because these are challenging to deliver remotely. Pre-recorded lectures limit my ability to interact with students. Therefore, I have elected to dedicate all lecture time to interacting with students. For each class there is a list of questions you are required to answer and hand-in. Prior to some classes there may be a Required Reading, that if completed will allow you to answer the day's assignment questions. Prior to the day of class you should complete the Required Reading. In addition, I can most effectively help you if you have read over the questions ahead of time. Course expectations: Any students that are disruptive, violating university policies, or acting in a potentially unsafe way will be warned and asked to leave. Learning goals: I consider your completed assignments to be a portfolio of your knowledge in population and evolutionary ecology. You will also get some exposure to coding in R. It takes time to become proficient in a programming language, but the time you will spend coding in this class will help you towards becoming more proficient. The course content emphasizes a deeper understanding of fewer concepts. You have the opportunity to further explore a topic of interest to you for the final project. Required Text and Resources: The course materials are online at https://ahurford.github.io/BIOL-3295-Fall-2020/. In addition you will need a computer to install R and RStudio. This will be covered on Thursday Sept 17 (see Chapter 4). Class announcements and WebEx links will be provided on the course BrightSpace and your assignments are to be submitted to BrightSpace. 1.3 Method of Evaluation 27 assignments (equal weighting) - 50% Midterm (due Fri Nov 6 at 5pm) - 15% Final Project (due Monday Dec 14 at 9am) - 35% You should aim to complete each assignment before the next class, but assignments will be accepted, without penalty, up to a week later. Late assignments, labs, and missed midterms, and final exams will be accommodated as described by University Regulation 6.7.3 and 6.7.5 (see https://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0474 for Regulations). 1.4 Additional Policies 1.4.1 Accommodation of students with disabilities Memorial University of Newfoundland is committed to supporting inclusive education based on the principles of equity, accessibility and collaboration. Accommodations are provided within the scope of the University Policies for the Accommodations for Students with Disabilities see www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239. Students who may need an academic accommodation are asked to initiate the request with the Glenn Roy Blundon Centre at the earliest opportunity (see www.mun.ca/blundon for more information). 1.4.2 Academic misconduct Students are expected to adhere to those principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. A student has the responsibility to know which actions, as described under Academic Offences in the University Regulations, could be construed as dishonest or improper. Students found guilty of an academic offence may be subject to a number of penalties commensurate with the offence including reprimand, reduction of grade, probation, suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information regarding this policy, students should refer to University Regulation 6.12. 1.4.3 Equity and Diversity A safe learning environment will be provided for all students regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, social origin, religious creed, religion, age, disability, disfigurement, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, source of income or political opinion. You should not photograph or record myself, teaching assistants, or other students in the class without first obtaining permission. Accommodation will be made for students with special needs. The sound should be turned off on phones and computers during class. 1.5 Additional Supports Resources for additional support can be found at: www.mun.ca/currentstudents/student/ https://munsu.ca/resource-centres/ 1.6 Tentative course schedule The course schedule is found in the toolbar of the class materials, see https://ahurford.github.io/BIOL-3295-Fall-2020/. The last day to drop the course without academic prejudice is Wednesday Nov. 4. 1.7 Handing in your work 1.7.1 Making figures to hand-in The graphs you hand in need to have descriptive axeses and a figure caption. You may put these elements together using a word processing software such as Microsoft Word. Elements of a good figure caption: Has a label, i.e., &quot;Figure 1&quot;, The first sentences provides a summary of what the figure shows, i.e., &quot;The price of oranges has increased steadily since 1964&quot;, Provide all necessary information to understand everything in the figure, i.e., if the figure has no legend, but multiple line types/symbols, be sure to indicate what is represented by the different symbols. If the axes labels are overly brief due to space constraints in the graph, provide a more thorough description in the figure caption. If any assumptions have been made in making the figure, disclose these, i.e., a point that was excluded from the analysis due to being considered an outlier. 1.7.2 Writing R scripts to hand-in To write your own R scripts follow the guidelines described in Chapter 7 Best Practices of Quantitative training in Biology. If you are asked to hand in your R script this means you need to submit an .R file on Brightspace. "],

Explain in 1-2 sentences the meaning of \\(\\lambda = 5\\). [1 mark] Suppose the number of lilypads during week 7 is 78,125. Let \\(\\lambda = 5\\), and assume that the units of \\(t\\) are weeks. Use equation (3) to calculate the number of lilypads in week 8. Show your calculations. [2 marks] Use your answer to question 2. to calculate the number of lilypads in week 9. Show your calculations. [2 marks] Equation (4) for the required reading assumes that \\(N_0=1\\), however, this formula can be generalized such that \\[ N_t = N_0\\lambda^t \\] where \\(N_t\\) is the population size at time, \\(t\\). Define time such that \\(t=0\\) is week 7 and \\(t\\) is then the number of weeks since week 7. Use the equation above to answer question 3 and confirm that the answer is the same (i.e., find the population size for week 9, when \\(\\lambda=5\\) and the population size for week 7 is 78,125). Show your calculations. [2 marks] Use the formula from question 4 to find the population size for week 15, where \\(N_0=1\\) and \\(\\lambda=5\\). Define time as the number of weeks since week 0. Show your calculations [2 marks] It is important to note that all mathematical formulas should have the same units on both sides of the equals sign, and for each term that is added or subtracted. The units of the population size, \\(N_t\\), at time, \\(t\\), are number. The geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\) is unitless. Choose an equation from the required reading and give the units for each of the terms to show that both sides of the equals have the same units. For example, for the equation that appears in question 4, we have: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} N_t &amp; = &amp; N_0 \\lambda^t \\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp;(\\mbox{number}) (\\mbox{unitless})^{weeks}\\\\ \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)&amp; =&amp; \\left(\\mbox{number}\\right)\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Note that: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} (\\mbox{unitless}) \\times (\\mbox{quantity with units}) &amp; = &amp; (\\mbox{quantity with units}) \\\\ (\\mbox{unitless})^{(\\mbox{quantity})}&amp; =&amp; (\\mbox{unitless}) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] [2 marks] Although not stated in the reading, \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\) where \\(b\\) is the per capita birth rate over one time step (i.e. one week for this example), and \\(d\\) is the fraction of the lilypad population that dies over one time step. The number 1 is considered unitless, what must the units of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) be? [1 mark] In the reading, \\(\\lambda = 2\\). Given that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b - d\\), what are some possible values of \\(b\\) and \\(d\\). Note that \\(d\\) is a fraction and must be \\(1 \\geq d \\geq 0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\). [1 mark] [True or False] For discrete time exponential growth (as per the reading), the change in population size from one week to the next depends not so much on the per capita birth rate, but on the difference between the per capita birth rate and the per capita death rate.

You should aim to complete this exercise before the next class. This exercise is due by Fri Sept 25. There will be a lot of carryover to the next exercise. The information below is taken from the following source: Newcomb, HR. 1940. Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35 pheasants. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. 5.1 Questions Read and complete all the exercises in Chapters 4.3 Variables and assignment to 4.10 R packages and 9 Making graphs in R of Quantitative skills for biology Answer all questions marked HAND IN in the reading [5 marks] To make a graph of the data listed in b.-d., we need to learn how to work with dates. We will consider two possible approaches: Use a built-in R function to convert dates to a format that can be plotted (todays class); and Convert the dates to number of days since a reference date. Now the dates are numbers and these values can be plotted on the x-axis of a graph (next class). In this question, we will proceed with option i. The function we will use is as.Date(). You can learn how to use this function using an internet search or by typing the following into your Console: ?as.Date These files can be difficult to understand (see R Help files. A good way to proceed is to experiment with the function in the Console. Try these: as.Date(2012-01-31, format = %Y-%m-%d) as.Date(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) Note that only the second command is error-free. The first command fails because the date argument for the as.Date() function must be a character string, i.e., must be enclosed in &quot;&quot; (see ?character). It is also possible to omit the format argument and just code: as.Date(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;). The help file notes that when the format argument is not specified, that formats will be tried one by one and an error will be returned if none work. It is advisable to specify the format, as allowing the function to infer the format could introduce errors. Chapter 6.9 Data structures describes how to make a vector (note a vector is a list of numbers rather than just a single number). We need to make a vector of the dates so that we can make our plot. For example, x &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2012-01-31&quot;, &quot;2012-03-05&quot;, &quot;2013-01-11&quot;), format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) Having completed Chapter 11 Making graphs in R, and having learned how to work with dates, you should now be able to write an R script to make plot using the information in b.-d. above. HAND IN A graph and figure caption. The graph should have dates on the x-axis and the pheasant population size on the y-axis drawing from the information provided in b.-d. You will need to guess the date of 'before the breeding season' as stated in b. and you should disclose the value of this guess in the figure caption. See 1.7.1 for more information. The solutions to this problem have figure caption that is 2 sentences long.

["PE2.html", "6 Tues Sept 22: Protection Island 2 6.1 Questions", " 6 Tues Sept 22: Protection Island 2 Continuing from last week, today we will try approach ii. to make the graph of the number of pheasants on Protection Island as it changes with time. Under approach ii. we will work with the dates by converting them to the number of days since a reference date. To do this we will use the julian() function, which is part of the chron package. Today's questions are due by Tues Sept 29, however, ideally you will have them completed for the next class. Read Section 4.4 of Quantitative skills for biology regarding installing packages. Install the package chron using either the Install button on the Packages tab, or by using the command install.packages(&quot;chron&quot;) in the Console window. Note that the package is only available for use once you check the box on the Packages tab or by running the following command in the Console: require(&quot;chron&quot;) After the chron package is loaded, we can then query the julian function, ?julian or use an internet search to better understand how to use it. As the help files can be difficult to understand, another approach to is to try out the function. Try the following: julian(1,1,1970) julian(1,2,1970) julian(2,1,1970) julian(1,1,1971) julian(1,1,1969) Which argument position of the julian() function corresponds to the month? Note also that by default the origin (the origin is when the returned value is 0) is set to January 1, 1970. Experiment by running the following lines of code: julian(1,1,2000) julian(1,1,2000, origin = c(1,1,1970)) julian(1,1,2000, origin = c(1,1,2000)) Finally, we need to make our figure. Recall that the plot function requires vectors of equal length for the x- and y-axes. Make a vector of the days since a reference date as follows: ref.day = c(1,1,2000) x = c(julian(1,1,2000, origin = ref.day), julian(1,1,2002, origin = ref.day)) If you run into problems you can query the value of x in your console, and you can use length(x) to check the length of x. 6.1 Questions You need to hand in a graph with descriptive axes and with a figure caption. The y-axis on your graph is population size and the x-axis will be created using the julian() function. Be sure to label the x-axis differently than you did for the previous assignment. See 1.7.1 for more information. The figure caption in the solutions for this problem is 2 sentences long. [10 marks] You also need to produce an R Script that makes the figure described above.

Ring-necked pheasant studies on Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington. MS thesis. Oregon State University. Pheasant chicks are born during the summer. In May 1937, 10 pheasants were introduced to the island. Before the next breeding season there were 35. November 10, 1938 a census estimated 110 pheasants. October 13, 1939 a census estimated 400 pheasants. Between the 1938 and 1939 censuses, Newcomb observed that 17 adult birds died. During the 1938 nesting season there were 5.86 eggs/nest. 83.57% of eggs hatched. During the 1939 nesting season there were 8.73 eggs/nest. 64.58% hatched. During the 1939 nesting season: Average number of chicks per clutch was 6.93.\\(^1\\) You can assume the sex ratio is 50:50 male to female. Pheasants are a sexually reproducing species. \\(^1\\) Note that g. and h. appear to be contradictory. 7.1 Questions Let \\(d\\) be the fraction of population that dies each year. Estimate \\(d\\) for the ring-tailed pheasant population on Protection Island? Write down any assumptions you have made. [3 marks] \\(b\\) is the per capita number of births each year. What is the value of \\(b\\)? Write down any assumptions you have made. [3 marks] Recall that \\(\\lambda = 1 + b-d\\). What is the value of \\(\\lambda\\)? Is this population is expected to grow over time? [2 marks] Lets assume that the pheasant population on Protection Island grows geoemetrically (i.e. exponentially but for a discrete time model) where the geometric growth rate, \\(\\lambda\\), is the value that you estimated in 3. Lets predict the population size each May beginning with May 1937. Let \\(N_0 = 10\\) and let \\(t\\) be the number of years since May 1937. Recall that when a population grows geometrically, \\[N_{t} = N_0 \\lambda^t \\] You can use R to do this calculation as follows (you should use your value of \\(\\lambda\\) from question 5, rather than lambda &lt;- 3 as in the example below): t &lt;-1 N0 &lt;-10 lambda &lt;-3 N0*lambda^t The result of N0*lambda^t is \\(N_{t+1}\\), and with \\(t=1\\) then \\(N_{t+1}=N_2\\): the population size two years after May 1937. You can change the value of \\(t\\) and repeat the calculation. Unless you have cleared your workspace it won't be necessary to re-input \\(N_0 = 10\\) and \\(\\lambda = 3\\). As such, you can calculate \\(N_3\\) with the following commands: t &lt;-2 N0*lambda^t HAND IN Use R to predict the value of the pheasant population size every year up until May 1940. You only need to hand in the values that you get, not an R Script. [2 marks] The approach to calculating the pheasant population size in Question 4 is not very organized. In this question, we will learn how to make a data frame, use a for loop, and use the function rbind(). Read Data structures in Quantitative training for biology. Create a one row dataframe called df: df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) Query df in your Console to see the data frame you have created. We would like to add successive values of the population size that we calculate to the data frame. To do this we use the rbind() function, which binds rows together. new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) Here the rbind() function takes the df dataframe and adds the new.result data frame as a new row onto the bottom. Note that the code above overwrites the value of df: that is, new.result is added to the bottom of the df dataframe (containing only one row), and the result is called df (which now has two rows), and the old dataframe df (with one row) is overwritten. As such, each time you run the command df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) another row is added to df. Try the following: new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) If you query the value of df you can see that the several rows, all with identical values have been added because we have run the command df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) multiple times while the value of new.result is unchanged. Now let's change the value of new.result between each time we run the df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) command. new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 1, popn.size = 20) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = 2, popn.size = 30) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) Type df into the Console to see the resulting dataframe. Finally, when we do calculations for a sequence of values, it is easier to code this using a for loop. lambda &lt;- 1.2 N0 &lt;- 10 df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) for(t in seq(1,4,1)){ val &lt;- N0*lambda^t new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = t, popn.size = val) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) } To understand the above code, after copy and pasting it into your Console, and running it by clicking Return, query the value of df: you should see predicted population sizes up until 4 years after May 1937. Now, lets try to understand seq(1,4,1). Let's learn about the seq() function by trying it out in the Console. What is the result of each of these? seq(-10,10) seq(-10,5,0.1) The for loop works by beginning with t equal to the first value of the sequence and stepping through each value until the final value. The code is written so that quantities that depend on t are inside the for loop (i.e., enclosed with in the {} and those that do not depend on t are outside the for loop). Note that val changes for different values of t, new.result changes for different values of t (because new.result has time = t and pop.size = val, where val depends on t). Finally, df also depends on t, because new.result depends on t. In contrast, N0 and lambda do not change with t, so it is more efficient to place the allocated values for these parameters outside of the loop. We can also plot the results of our calculations: lambda &lt;- 2 N0 &lt;- 10 df &lt;- data.frame(time = 0, popn.size = 10) for(t in seq(1,4,1)){ val &lt;- N0*lambda^t new.result &lt;- data.frame(time = t, popn.size = val) df &lt;- rbind(df, new.result) } plot(df$time, df$popn.size, typ = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;years since May 1937&quot;, ylab = &quot;Population size&quot;) If you already have an existing plot you can add new lines using lines(). For example, plot(seq(1,4), c(1,3,4,2), ylab = &quot;y-axis&quot;, xlab = &quot;x-axis&quot;) lines(seq(1,4), seq(1,4)) HAND IN Write an R scipt that builds on the file you have previously made protection-island.R. Use the lines() command to add the predicted population size assuming geometric growth using the commands described in this section. If you have written the code correctly the result should look something like this: Note that to get years on the x-axis for data from the protection-island.R file, I needed to plot plot(x/365,y) because with plot(x,y) the units on my x-axis were days. Your graph may look slightly different since you may have calculated a slightly different \\(\\lambda\\) value if you made different assumptions to me in questions 1 and 2. You are to hand in your R Script. See 1.7.2 for more information. [10 marks] "],

Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p4-8. Link We now have two ways of describing how population size changes with time whereby each individual has the same average number of offspring per unit time and the same probability of dying. Discrete time geometric growth: \\[\\begin{equation} N_t = N_0\\lambda^t \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] and, Continuous time exponential growth: \\[\\begin{equation} N(t) = N(0)e^{rt} \\tag{8.2} \\end{equation}\\] Notably, for both these models the per capita birth and death rates do not change change over time, and do not change with density or age. The notation \\(N_t\\) and \\(N(t)\\) is conventional for discrete time versus continuous time formulations respectively, however, these notations both mean the same: the population size at a particular time, \\(t\\). When \\(t=0\\) we have the population size at time 0: \\(N_0\\) or \\(N(0)\\). 8.2 Discrete or continuous time formulations Whether it is appropriate to model a population in a discrete time or continous time formulation depends on whether births and deaths are overlapping or neatly partitioned into a distinct time period. For example, for many animals there is a distinct breeding season: a short proportion of the year when offspring are born. As such, there is very little temporal overlap between the times of year when births and deaths occur. Humans are an example of a species that might reasonably be modelled as continuous time because babies are born year round. 8.3 Questions Please submit the answer to these questions to brightspace, ideally for the next class, but you have until Sept 30 to complete them without penalty. In equation (8.2), what is \\(e\\)? [1 mark] For what values of \\(r\\) does the population size increase over time? [1 mark] As described in the reading, \\(b\\) is a per capita birth rate, and \\(d\\) is a per capita death rate. For continuous time exponential growth, both \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) must be non-negative and can take values bigger than 1. Note that this differs from the discrete time model formulation where \\(0 \\leq d \\leq 1\\). When \\(d &gt; 1\\) in the continuous time formulation, this means that the average lifespan is less than one time step. For example, when \\(d = 2\\) this means that the average life expectancy for an individual is 1/2 a time step (i.e., days or year, however, the time unit is defined in the model). When the population size increases over time, what is true of \\(b\\) relative to \\(d\\)? [1 mark] For what value of \\(r\\) does \\(N(t)\\) not change over time? Hint: if \\(N(t)\\) is not changing then \\(N(t)=N(0)\\) for all \\(t\\). [1 mark] Consider the equation: \\[ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t). \\] As described in the reading, this is an alternative way to write the continuous time exponential growth equation. The quantity \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\\) can be understood as the slope of a graph where population size is on the vertical axis and time is on the horizontal axis. As such, if the slope is zero, \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}=0\\), then the population size is not changing. If \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&lt;0\\), then the population size is decreasing. For what value of \\(r\\) does the population size decrease? What is true about \\(b\\) relative to \\(d\\) in this instance? [2 marks] Which population would be more appropriate to be modelled as a continuous time formulation: E. coli bacteria or moose? [1 mark] Calculate the formula for the doubling time for continuous time exponential growth (equation (8.2)). This is the time for the population to double in size. The value of \\(N(0)\\), the population size at \\(t=0\\) doesn't matter as long as it is a positive number. When the population has doubled, \\(N(t) = 2N(0)\\). To answer this question you need to find \\(t\\) such that \\(N(t) = 2N(0)\\). You may need to revisit some rules about working with logarithms to complete this question (i.e. see here, specifically the Product, Quotient, Power, and Root table. Also recall, \\(Ln(e^x) = x\\)). Please show your work. [2 marks] Consider the following plot: Figure 8.1: An example of a very well thought out data visualation where the data might demonstrate exponential growth In this question, we will find the equation for 'doubles every day'. Our model is equation (8.2). This means that we will calculate the equation for 'doubles every day' under the assumption that cumulative COVID-19 deaths grow exponentially over time. To begin, we choose the time step for our model as days. The first problem we should consider is what is the value of \\(r\\) if the population doubles every 1 day? Make the appropriate substitutions and re-arrange equation (8.2) to find the value of \\(r\\). Now, note that the y-axis on the above graph is on a logarithmic scale. We will assume this is a base \\(e\\) logarithmic scale. Take the natural logarithm of both sides of equation (8.2). Note that the result should be the formula for a straight line, i.e., \\(y = mx + c\\), but where \\(y\\) is \\(Ln(N(t))\\) and \\(x\\) is \\(t\\) (to match the axes of Figure 8.1). The questions we are left to solve are: what is the slope of the line (i.e., \\(m\\), or the value of the coefficient that multiplies \\(t\\)), and what is the value of the intercept (i.e., \\(c\\) or the remaining terms on the opposite side of the equals to \\(Ln(N(t))\\) and which are not multiplied by \\(t\\))? Show all your work. Your answer is complete when you provide the numerical values of the slope and the intercept for the straight line corresponding to a doubling time of 1 day. Assume \\(N(0)=10\\). Your answers must be numbers - you will need to substitute the value of \\(r\\) that you calculated in the early part of this question. [2 marks] Provide the values of the slope and the intercept for doubling times of 2, 3, and 7 days. Again assume \\(N(0)=10\\). You do not need to show your work. [2 marks] "],
["tues-sept-29-doubling-time.html", "9 Tues Sept 29: Doubling time 9.1 Questions", " 9 Tues Sept 29: Doubling time DUE DATE: Thurs Oct 8 Today we will make a graph of the current COVID-19 data for Ontario. When only a small fraction of the population is resistant to an infection, the number of daily cases, in absence of any interventions such as physical distancing, is expected to grow exponentially over time. At the end of this exercise you will have calculated the doubling time for the second wave of COVID-19 in Ontario. Visit the website: https://art-bd.shinyapps.io/covid19canada/, this site is the front end for the data we will use which are archived here (also referred to as the back end). These data can easily be pulled into R using this command: COVID.data &lt;- data.table::fread(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada/master/timeseries_prov/active_timeseries_prov.csv&#39;, fill = TRUE) However, first you will need to install the data.table package: install.packages(&quot;data.table&quot;) When asked: Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel) enter no. To view the data type: head(COVID.data) ## province date_active cumulative_cases cumulative_recovered cumulative_deaths ## 1: Alberta 25-01-2020 0 0 0 ## 2: Alberta 26-01-2020 0 0 0 ## 3: Alberta 27-01-2020 0 0 0 ## 4: Alberta 28-01-2020 0 0 0 ## 5: Alberta 29-01-2020 0 0 0 ## 6: Alberta 30-01-2020 0 0 0 ## active_cases active_cases_change ## 1: 0 0 ## 2: 0 0 ## 3: 0 0 ## 4: 0 0 ## 5: 0 0 ## 6: 0 0 head() is a command that shows the first 6 lines of the quantity inside the round brackets. COVID.data is a very large table of data. If I type COVID.data into the Console I will get more information than I want, so I instead use head(). So far we have pulled data from an online repository. However, it is good practice to save these data in case later the repository is removed. We can make copy of the data for our records using the following commands: Note that the above contains the path to folders on my computer and saves COVID.data as the file COVID-data-save.csv. You will need to replace the path above with correct path to the folder on your own computer where you want to save these data. Setting the path is computer-specific, and so we always have problems with this in class because the solutions vary by student. Some tricks that work for me are: type getwd() into the Console. This will tell you the current working directory and can give you clues on the format of the path for your computer. clicking the Source button on a .R file that you have made will print the path to that .R file into the Console. elect to save the file somewhere very simple, for example, on your Desktop and then move it to a more organized place later. Navigate to the folder where you expected to save the data as a .csv file. You should be able to open the .csv file in Microsoft Excel. [THIS PART DOESN'T WORK - SORRY - JUST SKIP] Now, the data table COVID.data contains data for all provinces and we would like to subset the data so that only the information pertaining to Ontario is left. We do this as follows: data.ON &lt;- COVID.data[province == &quot;Ontario&quot;] We should understand what variables are contained in our data set. Query the following in your Console: colnames(data.ON) We will plot confirmed positive cases over time: plot(data.ON$cumulative_cases, ylab = &quot;Cumulative cases&quot;, typ = &quot;l&quot;) Note that we haven't provided an x-axis argument above. The x-axis should be date_active, however, from our previous exercise (Chapter 6), we recognize that dates need to be reformatted to be an appropriate x-axis. head(data.ON$date_active) ## [1] &quot;25-01-2020&quot; &quot;26-01-2020&quot; &quot;27-01-2020&quot; &quot;28-01-2020&quot; &quot;29-01-2020&quot; ## [6] &quot;30-01-2020&quot; The earliest date is January 25, 2020. We will use this as the origin and calculate the number of days since that time. require(chron) days.since &lt;- julian(as.Date(data.ON$date_active, format = &quot;%d-%m-%Y&quot;),origin=as.Date(&quot;25-01-2020&quot;, format = &quot;%d-%m-%Y&quot;)) If you get an error this may be because you have not installed the chron package. You can do so as install.packages(&quot;chron&quot;). On my first attempt at the above code, I tried julian(data.ON$date_active). This generated an error because our dates from the COVID-19 dataset are formatted as a character string &quot;01-25-2020&quot;, but the julian() function is expecting three numerical arguments julian(m,d,y). As such, julian(data.ON$Date) fails to provide three numerical arguments to the function and instead provides a single character string. For this reason the function as.Date() needs to be applied to data.ON$Date inside the julian() function. We now have a quantity days.since that is appropriate for the x-axis of our graph: plot(days.since, data.ON$cumulative_cases, ylab = &quot;cumulative cases&quot;, xlab = &quot;days since Jan 25, 2020&quot;, typ = &quot;l&quot;) However, rather than calculating cumumlative cases suppose that we might like to plot daily new cases. We do this by subtracting the cumulative cases for the previous day. The function diff() subtracts the element previous to the entry of a list and because the first element of the list has not preceeding value we add in a 0. new.cases &lt;- diff(c(0,data.ON$cumulative_cases)) plot(days.since, new.cases, ylab = &quot;new cases&quot;, xlab = &quot;days since Jan 25, 2020&quot;, typ = &quot;l&quot;) If we have done a good job of our work, it should be consistent with the official graph labelled as (B) below: We can also focus in on just the second wave by adjusting the xlim argument: plot(days.since[200:max(days.since)], new.cases[200:max(days.since)], ylab = &quot;new cases&quot;, xlab = &quot;days since Jan 25, 2020&quot;, pch = 16) Note that the second wave of COVID-19 in Ontario appears to be consistent with exponential growth. Recall that when the y-axis of the graph is on a logarithmic scale, exponential growth will be represented as a straight line. Figure 9.1: Straight lines illustrate exponential growth with different doubling times when the y-axis is plotted on a logarithmic scale We can estimate the doubling time of the number of new cases for the second wave of COVID-19 in Ontario by perfoming a linear regression on the natural logarithm of the number of new cases. Below, we consider only the data 224 days after January 25 and onwards. The function lm() performs the linear regression and abline() plots the regression. since.225 &lt;- days.since[225:max(days.since)] log.cases.225 &lt;- log(new.cases[225:max(days.since)]) plot(since.225,log.cases.225, ylab = &quot;log(new cases)&quot;, xlab = &quot;days since Jan 25, 2020&quot;, pch = 16) reg &lt;- lm(log.cases.225~since.225) abline(reg) summary(reg) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = log.cases.225 ~ since.225) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.26568 -0.16461 0.01192 0.10771 0.36850 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Firstly, as a change in population size over time, \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t), \\tag{11.1} \\end{equation}\\] such that if \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&gt;0\\), the population size, \\(N(t)\\) is increasing over time, and if \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}&lt;0\\), the population size is decreasing over time. Alternatively, we can write continuous time exponential growth as, \\[\\begin{equation} N(t) = N(0)e^{rt}, \\tag{11.2} \\end{equation}\\] where the lefthand side of equation (11.2) states the size of the population, \\(N(t)\\), at time \\(t\\), rather than the change in the size of the population, as it did in equation (11.1). For logistic growth, we have: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t)\\left(1 - \\frac{N(t)}{K} \\right). \\tag{11.3} \\end{equation}\\] How might we find the equivalent of equation (11.2) for logistic growth? i.e., for logistic growth, what is the equation for the size of the population at a particular time, \\(t\\)? If you are great at math, you might integrate equation (11.3) using separation of variables. However, another option, that we will build towards for next class, is to numerically integrate equation (11.3) using a computer. 11.1 What is an ordinary differential equation? In an introductory calculus course that covers integration, most often you are solving problems of the type: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{dy(x)}{dx} &amp;=&amp; x^2, \\\\ \\int \\frac{dy(x)}{dx} &amp;=&amp; \\int x^2 \\ dx, \\\\ y(x) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + c. \\tag{11.4} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Note that in the above calculations, we are able to use integration to find \\(y(x)\\) when we are given the rate of change equation, \\(\\frac{dy(x)}{dx}\\). In the above equations, \\(x\\), is the independent variable, \\(y(x)\\) is the dependent variable, the derivative of \\(y(x)\\) is with respect to \\(x\\), and \\(x\\) appears on the opposite side of the = to the derivative of the dependent variable. In the notation of population biology, where \\(N(t)\\) is conventional for the dependent variable, a similar problem might look like this: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\int \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} &amp;=&amp; \\int rt \\ dt, \\\\ \\nonumber N(t) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{1}{2}rt^2 + c. \\tag{11.5} \\end{eqnarray}\\] We have not seen any equations like equation (11.5) in BIOL 3295 so far: usually, our equations for the change in the population size, \\(\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\\), have a dependency on the population size, \\(N(t)\\) (the dependent variable), rather than a sole dependency on \\(t\\) (the independent variable). The equations that are models for population biology are sometimes ODEs. While some ODEs can be solved using math, commonly the ODEs that are used to model population dynamics need to be integrated numerically; that is, using a computer. 11.2 Numerically integrating an ordinary differential equation in R Numerical integration in R can be performed by installing this package: install.packages(&quot;deSolve&quot;) To integrate our ODE, we use the function ode() from the deSolve package. Let's look at the structure of this function. The mandatory arguments to the function are: ode(y,times,parms,func) where, y is a vector of the initial values of the dependent variable (i.e., those which correspond to the initial time). times is a sequence of time points that we will calculate the values of the variables; the first value of times is the initial time. func is a function that computes the values of the derivatives of the dependent variables. func must be defined as: func &lt;- function(t, y, parms,...). t is the current time point in the integration, and y is the current estimate of the variables in the ODE system. Given what we have learned in BIOL 3295 so far, y and times are not so tricky, but the func arguement requires us to write our own function, and so far we have only used functions written by other people: we have yet to write our own custom functions. In preparation for next class, when we will numerically integrate the logistic growth equation, we will next learn how to write custom functions. 11.3 Writing custom functions Generally, your code can still work without writing custom functions, however writing functions makes your code modular and more organized. Consider the following code: # Temperatures in Celcius temp.min.C &lt;- 10 temp.max.C &lt;- 20 # Temperatures in Farenheit temp.min.F &lt;- temp.min.C*9/5+32 temp.max.F &lt;- temp.max.C*9/5+32 The above code is fine, but since the same calculation is performed twice (conversion of Celcius to Farenheit), just with a different number, we might consider writing a custom function. Let's re-write the above code so that it now uses a custom function: # A function that converts Celcius to Farenheit C.to.F &lt;- function(C){ F &lt;- C*9/5 +32 return(F) } # Temperatures in Celcius temp.min.C &lt;- 10 temp.max.C &lt;- 20 # Temperatures in Farenheit temp.min.F &lt;- C.to.F(temp.min.C) temp.max.F &lt;- C.to.F(temp.max.C) Note that the above code consists of the function definition and the function call. The function definition uses the function function(). In the example, note the following: arglist is just one value: C. Generally, several values might be provided to the function where each should be separated by commas and enclosed within the (). expression can be any set of commands and should be enclosed within the {}. The function is assigned a name: C.to.F. We give the function a name so that we can use it later during a function call. 11.4 Questions The following is an equation for exponential population growth with a constant immigration rate, \\(m&gt;0\\), into the population: \\[ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt}= rN(t) + m \\] where \\(r\\) is the net reproductive rate, and \\(N(t)\\) is the population size at time, \\(t\\). Is this equation an ordinary differential equation (ODE)? Give 1 sentence explaining your reasoning [2 marks]. Write a function that adds 123 to a user supplied argument, and then write the line of code that calls the function to evaluate 123+1, and assigns the result the variable name y. You are to hand in your R script. [5 marks] "],

Today we would like to write a custom function that satisfies the requirements of the func argument that is supplied to ode() so that numerical integration can be performed. 12.1 Writing the func argument for ode() The func argument of ode() has the following constraints: The arglist must include t, y, and parms. The value returned must be a list of the rates of change in the dependent variable(s). Note that if your ODE comprises of more than one variable that is changing over time, then y will be a vector. Below is an example of how func might be coded for exponential growth. Remember that the ODE for exponential growth is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t) \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] Below equation (12.1) is coded in the appropriate syntax for eventual use in the ode() function: # Write a function that returns a list of the rate of change in your dependent variables. model = function(t,y,parms){ # It&#39;s a personal perference of mine to switch the symbols # to be consistent with the equation. N &lt;- y[1] # This is this equation for dN/dt dN &lt;- r*N # The function returns the value of the change in N. return(list(c(dN))) } Let's try out the function to make sure it works. Copy and paste the function into your Console and then type: r&lt;-1 model(1,2,parms=NULL) Did you get 2? Does it make sense to you that the returned value is 2? Try some other values. Are the values making sense? Now that the func argument of ode() has been demonstrated, the remaining arguments for the ode() function are not so bad. # The initial value of N yini&lt;- c(N = 1) # the times for the numerical integration times &lt;- seq(0, 1, by = .1) Rembember to assign a value for r: # Asign a value to the parameter: r &lt;- 2 And then once all the arguments are set, call the function, and plot the results: # performing the numerical integration out &lt;- ode(y = yini, parms = NULL, times = times, func = model) out &lt;- data.frame(out) head(out) # this line overrides a multipanel plot.

Generally, the below line isn&#39;t necessary. par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # Make the graph plot(out$time, out$N, typ = &quot;l&quot;) 12.2 Questions For the code model(1,2,parms=NULL) (where the function model is defined above), what do 1 and 2 correspond to? One of these quantities does not affect the value that the model() function returns. Which quantity does not affect the value the function returns? [2 marks] Write an R Script that numerically integrates the logistic growth function (equation (11.3)). Choose a value of \\(r\\) such that the population size increases over time. Remember to use good practices for writing your script - see 1.7.2. Your script should produce a graph with \\(N(t)\\) on the y-axis and time on the x-axis [10 marks] Add to your script from 2. such that another graph is produced, this time where the population size decreases over time. Note that this should just require adding new lines to the bottom of your question 1 script such that you: a) set a new value of r; b) run the ode() command; and c) make the graph. In other words, it is not necessary to define the logistic growth function, model, again because that has not changed. Further, if you are happy to use the same values of times as for question 1, you do not need to restate this either. Answer this question by adding a few lines of code to your answer to 1. You are to hand in your R script. You should answer both questions 1. and 2. in the same R script. [5 marks] "],
