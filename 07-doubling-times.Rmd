# Fri Sept 25: Exponential growth (continuous time)

## Required reading
Vandermeer, J.H., Goldberg, D.E., 2013. Population Ecology: First Principles (Second Edition). Princeton University Press, Princeton, United States. p4-8. [Link](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/detail.action?docID=1205619)

We now have two ways of describing how population size changes with time whereby an each individual has the same average number of offspring per unit time and the same probability of dying.

1) Discrete time geometric growth:

\begin{equation}
N_t = N_0\lambda^t
(\#eq:Geo)
\end{equation}

and,

2) Continuous time exponential growth

\begin{equation}
N(t) = N(0)e^{rt}
(\#eq:Exp)
\end{equation}

Notably, for both these models the birth and death rates do not change change over time, and do not change with density or age.

The notation $N_t$ and $N(t)$ is conventional for discrete time versus continuous time formulations respectively, however, these notations both mean the same: the population size at a particular time, $t$. When $t=0$ we have the population size at time 0: $N_0$ or $N(0)$.

## Discrete or continuous time formulations
Whether it is appropriate to model a population in a discrete time or continous time formulation depends on whether births and deaths are overlapping or neatly partitioned into a distinct time period. For example, for many animals there is a distinct breeding season: a short proportion of the year when offspring are born. As such, there is very little temporal overlap between the times of year when births and deaths occur. Humans are an example of a species that might reasonably be modelled as continuous time because babies are born year round.

## Questions

1. In equation \@ref(eq:Exp), what is $e$?
2. For what values of $r$ does the population size increase over time?
3. As described in the reading, $b$ is a per capita birth rate, and $d$ is a per capita death rate. Both $b$ and $d$ must be non-negative and can take values bigger than 1. Note that this differs from the discrete time model formulation where $0 \leq d \leq 1$. When $d > 1$ in the continuous time formulation, for example, $d = 2$ this means that the average life expectancy for an individual is 1/2 a time unit (i.e., days or year, however, the time unit is defined in the model). When the population size increases over time, what is true of $b$ relative to $d$?
4. For what value of $r$ does $N(t)$ not change over time?
5. Consider the equation:
\[
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = rN(t).
\]
As described in the reading, this is an alternative way to write the continuous time exponential growth equation. The quantity $\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$ can be understood as the slope of a graph of population size versus time. As such, if the slope is zero, $\frac{dN(t)}{dt}=0$, then the population size is not changing. If $\frac{dN(t)}{dt}<0$ then the population size is decreasing. For what value of $r$ does the population size decrease? What is true about $b$ relative to $d$ in this instance? 

6. Which population would be more appropriate to be modelled as a continuous time formulation: _E. coli_ bacteria or moose?

7. Calculate the formula for the doubling time for continuous time exponential growth. This is the time for the population to double in size. The value of $N(0)$, the population size at $t=0$ doesn't matter as long as it is a positive number. When the population has doubled $N(t) = 2N(0)$. To answer this question you need to find $t$ such that $N(t) = 2N(0)$. You may need to revisit some revisit some rules about working wiht logarithms to complete this question (i.e. see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm), specifically the _Product, Quotient, Power, and Root_ table. Also recall, $Ln(e^x) = x$).

8. In the next class we will aim to produce a plot such as this:
