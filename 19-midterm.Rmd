<!-- ## Chapter 6 in Sherratt and Wikinson -->

<!-- Chapter 6. _Is Nature Chaotic_ of (Big problems in ecology and evolution) [https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/mun/reader.action?docID=430616&ppg=136] by Sherratt and Wilkinson. -->

<!-- 1. What is chaos? -->

<!-- 1. Write down a population model that produces chaos? Define all the parameters and variables in the model. -->

<!-- 1. For the population model from your previous answer, for what values of the parameters does chaos occur? -->

<!-- 1. What is the butterfly effect? -->

<!-- 1. Give one example of a laboratory experiment that showed evidence of chaos. List one limitation of this experiment. Provide the full citation. -->

<!-- 1. Give one natural (non-laboratory) example of a population that may show chaotic dynamics. List one limitation of this study. Provide the full citation. -->

<!-- 1. Overall, based on Sherratt and Wilkinson is their evidence that biological populations exhibit chaotic dynamics. -->

<!-- Eigenvalue for 2 x 2 matrix computational -->

<!-- Numerical solutions for a density dependence in births model -->

<!-- Draw a life cycle diagram for Vandermeer -->
