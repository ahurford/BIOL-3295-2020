<!-- 3.	For the discrete time exponential (geometric) growth model, ideally the census points should be a fixed amount of time apart, i.e., a day, a week, or a year. Provide 1-3 sentences discussing the timing of the census points for Protection Island. [5 marks] -->

<!-- What is chaos? -->
<!-- Do real populations exhibit chaos? Discuss the evidence for and against. Provide citations. -->

<!-- 8.	The geometric growth model is called ‘discrete time’. This equation is appropriate for populations that have regular, pulse reproduction, for example, pheasants that reproduce once per year in the summer. Can you think of examples of other species that reproduce like this? -->

<!-- 9.	Can you think of any species that reproduce continuously throughout the year? These species are better modelled with a continuous time model. -->
