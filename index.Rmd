# Thurs Sept 10: Syllabus

## Accessing the peer-reviewed literature

## Reading papers

## Handing in your work

### Making figures to hand-in {#figures}
The graphs you hand in need to have descriptive axeses and a figure caption. You may put these elements together using a word processing software such as _Microsoft Word_.

### Writing R scripts to hand-in {#RScript}
To write your own R scripts follow the guidelines described in Chapter 7 [Best Practices](https://ahurford.github.io/quant-guide-all-courses/style.html) of _Quantitative training in Biology_. If you are asked to hand in your R script this means you need to submit an `.R` file to your dropbox on brightspace.
